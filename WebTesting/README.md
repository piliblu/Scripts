## Instructions:
1.	Unzip the Store and put it in a Windows Server (or computer) 
  - *Remember: This is a vulnerable application so DO NOT place the store web app in a production server or computer*
  - *Disable the Windows Firewall (or at least create rules to enable port 80)
2.	Install NodeJS (node-v9.11.1-x64)
3.	Unzip the STORE content on the Windows System, and start the web server by opening a command window from the store folder on the desktop (or any other place) and type **npm start** 
4.	Use this link to download the files: https://1drv.ms/u/s!Akx-RZJY3gu53CmciCI2JIU2yWMH?e=ald0lF ()

Use your local computer (or any other VM connected as NAT or Bridge) to access the web sever.
